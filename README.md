Evil--Dynamic--Hangman
======================
A game of hangman:

This is a version of hangman that allows the user to guess letters to uncover a hidden word of length that the user chooses.
The user allots him or herself a total number of guesses to uncover the letter. 
The user also chooses how difficult that game will be. 
The program "changes" the hidden word to make the game as hard as possible by dynamically generating a new pool of possible words to fit the current pattern  of revealed letters. 
The game plays until the user guesses all the letters, or runs out of guesses. Note: Error occurs when 16 letters is chosen as word length.
